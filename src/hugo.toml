# Include or exclude specific files when deploying to this target:
# If exclude is non-empty, and a local or remote file's path matches it, that file is not synced.
# If include is non-empty, and a local or remote file's path does not match it, that file is not synced.
# Note: local files that don't pass the include/exclude filters are not uploaded to remote,
